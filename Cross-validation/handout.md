# Introduction

A large section of statitics deals with the creation, adjustment and verification of models derived from actual observations. To evaluate a model we need to know how "accurate" phenomenon is captured by the model and how suitable the model is to extrapolate the phenomenon into the future. To indicate the goodness of fit we employ different key figures which describe how well a model fits a set of observations.
