# Introduction

A large section of statistics deals with the creation, adjustment and verification of models derived from actual observations. To evaluate a model we need to know how "accurate" phenomenon is captured by the model and how suitable the model is to extrapolate the phenomenon into the future. To indicate the goodness of fit we employ different key figures which describe how well a model fits a set of observations. The goodness of fit of a simple liniar regression can for example be expressed with the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Another procedure which can provide us with key figures for the goodness of fit for a model is the cross-validation.
